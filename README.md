### Open Computer Vision

```python
pip install cv2
```

- Computers Gain High Level Understanding from Digital Images or Videos.
- Understand and Automate the Task of Human Visual System.
- Detecting and Image | Object Labeling has Surpassed Humans.
- Faster than Human Reaction and 99% Accuracy
- High Amount of Visual Data (Images and Videos) with Processing Capabilities.

### Image Processing
- **Extract Infromation** from Image | **Enhance** the Image
- Computers Visualize Images as a **Matrix**.
- Each Element in Matrix is a **Pixel**.
- Each Pixel in Color have Color Information composed of `3 Channels` **B G and R** containing Numbers from 0 to 255  
- Each Pixel of Matrix represents the **Intensity** of an Image
- Each Channel need **8 Bits** for Storage therefor it become **24 Bits** for each Pixel.

### Images are converted to and from **NumPy** Array

### Storage Requirements

1. Binary : `1 Bit` Per Pixel
2. Black and White : `8 Bits` Per Pixel | `1 Channel`
3. Grayscale : `8 Bits` Per Pixel | `1 Channel`
4. Color : `24 Bits` Per Pixel | `3 Channels`

### Pixel
- Basic **Fundamental Unit** of Image 
- Multiple Pixels arranged in **Rows** and **Columns** forms an **Image**
- Binary, Black and White, Grayscale, RGB Color Image

> Black and White and Greyscale Images are **Different**
- Black and White is only Composed with Black or White
- Grayscale is combination of Different Grades of Black and White.

- **Binary** need `1 Bit Per Pixel` for Storage and **Black** and **White** needs `8 Bits Per Pixel` for **Storage**.
- Black and White will be **Dense** and shall render **Better Quality**.

### Applications 
1. Self Driving Cars (Detect Objects and Humans infront of Car, Reverse Parking)
2. Facial Recognition (Attendance, FB Friend Recognition)
3. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality
4. Health Care (X Ray and MRI Scan)
5. Video Motion Analysis (Detect Face, Object in Video)
6. Image Segmentation (Camera Detects the Multiple Faces in a Group Selfie)
7. Scene Reconstruction (3D Model Creation in Architecture)
8. Image Restoration (Filtering Blur Images and Removing Noise)
