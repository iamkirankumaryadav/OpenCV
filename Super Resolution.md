# `Super Resolution` in OpenCV

- `Super resolution` refers to the process of `upscaling` or `improving` the details of the image.
- When increasing the `dimensions` of an image, extra pixels need to be `interpolated` (alter or insert something new)
- Basic image processing techniques do not give good results as they do not take the surrounding in context while scaling up.
